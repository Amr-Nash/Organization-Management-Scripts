"Volume 47, Issue 6","March 19, 2021",The Evolution of Resource-Based Inquiry: A Review and Meta-Analytic Integration of the Strategic Resources–Actions–Performance Pathway,"Understanding why some firms outperform others is central to strategy research. The resource-based view (RBV) suggests that competitive advantages arise due to possessing strategic resources (i.e., assets that are valuable, rare, nonsubstitutable, and inimitable), and researchers have extended this logic to explain performance differences. However, RBV is relatively silent about the actions managers could use to create or capitalize on a resource-based advantage. Enriching RBV, the resource orchestration framework describes specific managerial actions that use such resources to realize performance gains. After reviewing the conceptual evolution of these two literature streams as well as related streams, we use meta-analytic structural equation modeling to aggregate evidence from 255 samples involving 111,120 observations to answer outstanding research questions regarding the strategic resources–actions–performance pathway. The results show strong complementarity and interdependence between their logics. Additional inquiry drawing on their complementarity is a clear path toward enhancing scholars’ understanding of how and why some firms outperform others. We build on our findings to lay a foundation for such inquiry, including a call for theorizing centered on the interdependence of resources and actions, as well as new theoretical terrain that can help resource-based inquiry continue to evolve.",42,30,,"resource-based theory, resource orchestration, firm performance, meta-analysis, meta-analytic structural equation modeling",,,Laura D’Oria,Iowa State University,,,T.

"Volume 47, Issue 5","ary 24, 2020",Gritty Leaders Promoting Employees’ Thriving at Work,"Four studies (a vignette-based experiment conducted in Portugal and Brazil, a two-wave multisource field study in Portugal, a three-wave field study in the United States, and a multisource field study in Portugal), in which conscientiousness, a “rival” of grit, was controlled for, provide theoretical and empirical evidence for a model testing what (e.g., grit in leaders), why (e.g., employee self-attributed grit), and when (e.g., leader support) grit supports thriving at work. First, gritty employees are more likely to thrive. Second, conveyed leader grit (i.e., grit as perceived by employees) predicts employee grit. Third, conveyed leader grit and leader self-attributed grit are conceptually different, and although the two relate positively with employee self-attributed grit, the former is a better predictor of employee self-attributed grit. Fourth, leader support operates as a boundary condition, in that the indirect association of conveyed leader grit with employee thriving is stronger when the leader is perceived as supportive. Our research also indicates that the concept of grit is more textured than habitually considered and that more attention must be paid to the boundary conditions of its development and impact.",25,27,,"conveyed leader grit, leadership, perceived leader support, self-attributed grit, thriving at work",,,Arménio Rego,"Católica Porto Business School, and Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL)",,,Flávia Cavazotte,Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro,,,Miguel Pina e Cunha,Universidade Nova de Lisboa,,,Camilo Valverde,Católica Porto Business School,,,Marcel Meyer,Universidad de Navarra,,,Luca Giustiniano,LUISS Guido Carli University,,
"Volume 47, Issue 3","July 24, 2019","Abusive Supervision Differentiation and Employee Outcomes: The Roles of Envy, Resentment, and Insecure Group Attachment","When employees experience distressful events such as abusive supervision, they often rely on their workgroup for sense making and social support. However, research also shows that supervisors tend to differentially abuse members of the same group (i.e., abusive supervision differentiation, ASD). We argue that this behavior threatens an employee’s socioemotional bond with and reliance on the workgroup for support. Specifically, ASD drives negative comparisons of “self versus others” that diminish one’s socioemotional relationship with the group as a whole, particularly if one experiences more abuse than others. Drawing on attachment theory, we develop an individual-level conceptual model that links perceptions of ASD to employee outcomes through two forms of unhealthy person-group bonding—group attachment anxiety and group attachment avoidance. The results of two studies show that group attachment anxiety and avoidance uniquely explain the effects of ASD perceptions, over and above group identification. While both attachment patterns mediated the effects of ASD on psychological distress, group attachment avoidance primarily mediated the effects on quit intentions, and group attachment anxiety primarily mediated the effects on interpersonal deviance (Study 2). In addition, Study 2 demonstrates that resentment and envy towards other group members explain why ASD perceptions lead to group attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and subsequent outcomes. Lastly, we find some evidence that the indirect effects of ASD perceptions are more detrimental when one perceives greater (vs. less) personal exposure to abusive supervision. We conclude by discussing the implications of group attachment theory and targeted emotions for understanding ASD.",27,24,,"abusive supervision, differentiation, attachment theory, group attachment, attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, envy, resentment",,,Babatunde Ogunfowora,,,,Justin M.

"Volume 47, Issue 2","March 4, 2019",Received Respect and Constructive Voice: The Roles of Proactive Motivation and Perspective Taking,"This study advances voice research by offering a social-relational view of the drivers of voice, a theoretical approach to voice that is seldom considered within the current paradigm largely focused on personality traits, job conditions, and organizational characteristics. One overlooked yet important social-relational antecedent of voice is received respect. Our core premise is that when employees believe they are respected by coworkers, they experience psychological changes to their control beliefs (representing “can-do” proactive motivation) and positive mood (representing “energized-to” proactive motivation), which then motivate voice. We further consider another social-relational variable—perspective taking—as a predictor of received respect and therefore as an indirect predictor of voice. Through a multimethod, multisample research program comprising four studies (two experiments involving more than 400 subjects in total, a sample involving more than 700 matched employee-coworker and subordinate-supervisor dyads, and a 9-week within-person field investigation of more than 400 university alumni), we provide evidence to support the proposed model. That is, received respect was associated with employees’ voice through control beliefs and positive mood, and perspective taking was a prominent predictor of received respect.",29,29,,"voice, respect, proactive motivation, perspective taking",,,Thomas W.

"Volume 47, Issue 1","March 24, 2020",The Use of Signals in New-Venture Financing: A Review and Research Agenda,"The use of signals to overcome information asymmetries and reduce the uncertainty inherent in resource acquisition has become a prominent theme in new-venture financing literature. In particular, the assessment of a wide range of different information signals, with the aim of conveying a venture’s quality and legitimacy to prospective investors, is receiving increased scholarly attention. With contributions from a broad spectrum of diverse research foci investigating interactions with distinct types of investors, the literature on entrepreneurial signaling in new-venture financing has become fragmented, and this is harming further development of the field. This study systematically reviews the different literature streams on entrepreneurial signaling to provide a more integrative framework, which can contribute to the cumulative and evidence-based body of knowledge about the role of entrepreneurial signaling in new-venture financing. Furthermore, the authors identify critical sender-, signal-, receiver-, and environment-related boundary conditions that influence the signaling effectiveness. In this way, the authors identify gaps in the existing literature and map directions for future research.",78,77,,"new-venture finance, entrepreneurship, signals, signaling theory",,,Oskar Colombo,University of Giessen,,
"Volume 47, Issue 7","March 26, 2021",Stakeholder Theory and the Resource-Based View of the Firm,"We start this article with the exploration of similarities between the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) and stakeholder theory at the time of their origination and then proceed with the conversation on what led to distinct developmental trajectories of the two theories. Though RBV has become a leading paradigm in the strategic management field, we argue that in its current form, RBV is yet incomplete. We suggest there are four aspects that stakeholder theory can offer to inform RBV: normativity, sustainability, people, and cooperation. Reconciling stakeholder theory and RBV is a promising path to advancing our understanding of management, and we provide a two-part guideline to management scholars and practitioners who would be willing to take this path.",115,73,,"cooperation, normativity, people, resourced-based view, stakeholder theory, sustainability",,,R.

"Volume 47, Issue 3","May 4, 2020",Psychological Ownership: A Meta-Analysis and Comparison of Multiple Forms of Attachment in the Workplace,"This quantitative review systematically integrates the antecedents and outcomes of psychological ownership (PO) and examines its incremental validity and explanatory power compared with two other forms of workplace attachment (i.e., organizational commitment and organizational identification). Across 141 studies published over 20 years, our meta-analysis shows that apart from the factors related to the three traditional categories of PO antecedents (i.e., control, knowing, and investment), safety (e.g., organizational justice, trust, perceived organizational support, and relational closeness) is an emerging antecedent leading to PO. In addition, we find that PO is related not only to employees’ attitudinal and performance outcomes but also to some dark-side outcomes (e.g., territorial behaviors). Furthermore, after applying two advanced methods, that is, two-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling and dominance analysis, to the analysis of 294 studies (including 291 primary studies and three published meta-analyses), the results reveal that PO has an incremental validity above that of organizational commitment and organizational identification in predicting employees’ in-role performance and organizational citizenship behaviors.

"Volume 47, Issue 8","August 21, 2020",When Is a Governmental Mandate not a Mandate? Predicting Organizational Compliance Under Semicoercive Conditions,"While institutional theorists have long viewed governmental mandates as a prototypical coercive pressure generating homogeneous organizational compliance, we suggest that such mandates are often subject to enforcement uncertainty, resulting in a pressure more aptly characterized as “semicoercive” and a compliance result more aptly characterized as heterogeneous. We advance and test a theoretical framework to predict the specific form of heterogeneous compliance in semicoercive contexts, with particular attention to the differential sensitivity of firms to pressures to comply, based on differences in their specific legal, political, and social context. We use the setting of a mandated corporate governance reform in China requiring listed Chinese firms to add independent directors and find general evidence of noncompliance and more specific evidence consistent with the predictions from our sociopolitical framework. We discuss the implications of our theoretical approach and findings for future research on institutional environments, governmental regulations, organizational compliance, and corporate governance.",14,12,,"corporate governance, institutional change, board of directors, state ownership, enforcement uncertainty, organizational compliance",,,Xuanli Xie,Peking University,,,Wei Shen,Arizona State University,,,Edward J.

"Volume 47, Issue 1","November 4, 2020",The Organizational Improvisation Landscape: Taking Stock and Looking Forward,"Over the past 25 years, scholars have produced a wide variety of organizational improvisation (OI) scholarship from multiple fields that has improved our understanding of the OI phenomenon. However, because of its complexity and the heterogeneity of approaches used to study it, OI remains challenging to grasp. This makes it difficult for scholars to understand the contributions of this literature both in terms of extant findings as well as potential gaps and future areas of inquiry. Accordingly, we take stock of the extant literature by reviewing 186 peer-reviewed scholarly articles on OI primarily from management and related fields such as entrepreneurship and marketing as well as other disciplines such as information systems and communications. We introduce an aggregate framework that emphasizes the sequential process of OI. We also identify specific theoretical and associated empirical gaps in each of the pre-, during, and post-phases of an OI episode. We specifically address questions surrounding the origination and content of initial improvisational actions, conceptual ambiguity regarding the prevalence of OI, and the confounding of causal factors that impact the outcomes following an OI episode.",39,39,,"organizational improvisation, organizational learning, innovation, entrepreneurship",,,Michael P.

"Volume 47, Issue 1","November 9, 2020",The Emergence of Emergent Leadership: A Comprehensive Framework and Directions for Future Research,"There has been increasing attention to examining informal (i.e., horizontal), rather than formal (i.e., vertical), approaches to leadership over the last several decades, enhancing our understanding of the dynamics of emergent leadership. Although such research has led to a growing comprehension of the process of, and factors involved in, leader emergence, the literature still lacks theoretical coherence. Without a clear way to connect and synthesize extant research, the time is right for a much-needed comprehensive review. To address this issue, we examine emergent leadership research to date with the aim of developing a concise overview and comprehensive framework of the literature. In doing so, we (1) review past conceptualizations, establish a clear, common definition, and compare emergent leadership to other related constructs; (2) review previous operationalizations and provide recommendations for future measurement; (3) develop a comprehensive organizing framework of existing research; and (4) use our organizing framework, as well as three existing theories related to emergent leadership, to generate a series of detailed suggestions for future research for the next decade and beyond.",37,43,,"leadership, emergent leadership, leader emergence, framework",,,Andrew A.

"Volume 47, Issue 8","May 28, 2020",Reducing Customer-Directed Deviant Behavior: The Roles of Psychological Detachment and Supervisory Unfairness,"Conservation of resources (COR) theory proposes that mistreatment by customers (termed “customer mistreatment”) can deplete employees’ resources, lessen their ability to regulate their behaviors, and result in them engaging in customer-directed deviant behavior. However, COR has been criticized for its lack of precision regarding how this process unfolds. Integrating the person-situation interactionist perspective with COR theory, the present paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of COR theory by explicating how individual characteristics and work context—namely, psychological detachment and supervisory unfairness—can combine to attenuate/exacerbate the relationship between customer mistreatment and employees’ customer-directed deviant behavior. Using a multilevel field study with 1,092 daily-based surveys among 157 Korean call-center representatives, our results show that frontline employees’ emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between customer mistreatment and customer-directed deviant behavior that occurs on the next working day. When faced with customer mistreatment, employees with lower (vs. higher) psychological detachment were more likely to be emotionally exhausted and engage in customer-directed deviant behavior on the next working day. Moreover, their emotional exhaustion predicted customer-directed deviant behavior more so when their supervisors treated them unfairly (vs. fairly). Taken together, the results show that the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion was strongest among employees with low (vs. high) psychological detachment and who reported more (vs. less) supervisory unfairness. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications as well as directions for future research are discussed.",24,18,,"customer service, deviant/counterproductive behavior, resource-based view, resource allocation/management",,,Young Ho Song,University of Windsor,,,Daniel P.

"Volume 47, Issue 6","December 21, 2020",What Happens to Bad Actors in Organizations? A Review of Actor-Centric Outcomes of Negative Behavior,"Negative workplace behavior has received substantial research attention over the past several decades. Although we have learned a lot about the consequences of negative behavior for its victims and third-party observers, a less understood but equally important research question pertains to the consequences for bad actors: How does engaging in negative behavior impact one’s thoughts, feelings, and subsequent behaviors? Moreover, do organizational members experience costs or benefits from engaging in negative acts? We address these questions with an integrative review of empirical findings on various actor-centric consequences of a wide range of negative behaviors. We organize these findings into five dominant theoretical perspectives: affective, psychological-needs, relational, psychological-resources, and cognitive-dissonance perspectives. For each perspective, we provide an overview of the theoretical arguments, summarize findings of relevant studies underlying it, and discuss observed patterns and contradictory findings. By doing so, we provide a very tentative answer to our initial questions, contending that engaging in negative acts is a two-edged sword for actors and its costs seem to slightly prevail over its benefits. Nevertheless, we make this preliminary conclusion based upon an incomplete knowledge base. In order to further our understanding of actor-centric outcomes of negative behavior, we also identify several important research gaps and needed future research directions.",18,14,,"negative workplace behavior, deviant/counterproductive behavior, actor-centric outcomes, perpetrator, well-being, cognitive dissonance",,,Rui Zhong,University of British Columbia,,,Sandra L.

"Volume 47, Issue 5","April 30, 2020",Decentralized Governance of Digital Platforms,"Over the past decade, the rise of blockchain technology has led to the emergence of a growing number of decentralized platforms that are governed less by platform owners and more through community efforts. The emergence of blockchain platforms offers a unique opportunity to examine alternative structures for platform governance and to develop a theory around the value of centralized, semi-decentralized, and decentralized governance. Drawing on mechanism design theory, we evaluate the tradeoffs between centralization and decentralization and hypothesize semi-decentralization as a higher performing governance structure. Empirical evidence from the blockchain industry shows that decentralization has an inverted U-shaped relationship with platforms’ market capitalization, developer attention, and development activity. We further examine factors driving the decentralization of platform governance and find that digital platforms of the infrastructure layer—relative to those of the application layer—have a tendency to become more decentralized. This tendency, nevertheless, can be offset by experienced leaders to achieve semi-decentralization. Overall, this study contributes new insights on the characteristics, antecedents, and consequences of effective platform governance.",71,69,,"platform governance, shared governance, decentralization, digital platform, blockchain, mechanism design",,,Yan Chen,Stevens Institute of Technology,,,Jack I.

"Volume 47, Issue 3","April 26, 2020",Opportunity/Threat Perception and Inertia in Response to Discontinuous Change: Replicating and Extending Gilbert (2005),"We use extensive longitudinal data from companies in the book retailing and telecommunication industries to replicate and extend Gilbert’s qualitative study on the influence of opportunity/threat perceptions on resource rigidity and routine rigidity in incumbents’ responses to discontinuous change. After discovering important anomalies in an empirical generalization study, we engage in a generalization and extension study to unbundle opportunity/threat perception into the dimensions of gain/loss framing and perceived control and induce a revised theory of the effect of such appraisals on incumbent inertia. Specifically, we induce that (a) imminent loss framing relaxes resource rigidity only when decision makers perceive a moderate level of control; (b) resource rigidity also relaxes in response to gain framing, at least when decision makers perceive the discontinuity as a particularly relevant strategic issue and strongly sense that they can control it; (c) loss framing and low perceived control can amplify routine rigidity by exacerbating resource rigidity; and (d) structural separation creates perceptions of gain and control by fostering the emergence of a local organizational identity in the unit implementing the discontinuous change. We resolve long-debated contradictions in studies on managerial and organizational cognition and discontinuous change, particularly between studies invoking threat rigidity theory and studies invoking prospect theory. We also demonstrate the usefulness of replicating qualitative research that is based on multiple case comparison.",17,15,,"inertia, discontinuous change, cognitive framing, innovation, prospect theory, threat rigidity theory",,,Andreas König,University of Passau,,,Lorenz Graf-Vlachy,ESCP Business School,,,Markus Schöberl,University of Passau,,
"Volume 47, Issue 6","December 23, 2020",Unit-Level Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB): A Conceptual Review and Quantitative Summary,"Despite assumptions that counterproductive work behavior (CWB) leads to detrimental outcomes for organizations, most of the existing CWB research focuses on outcomes for the individual employee. In the present study, we clarify fundamental issues regarding unit-level CWB, including its definition and how it is distinct from individual-level CWB. We then use social information-processing (SIP) theory as a lens to articulate our hypotheses regarding the factors associated with unit-level CWB’s emergence (e.g., collective attitudes, human resources practices, leadership) as well as its relationship with unit-level performance (e.g., profit, customer satisfaction). We use meta-analysis (representing 7,110 units and over 391,000 employees) to test our hypotheses. Our results show that unit-level CWB is significantly related to antecedents such as collective job attitudes, the use of strategic human resource management practices (e.g., staffing, training, rewards), and collective perceptions of the work environment (e.g., unit-level fairness perceptions). Moreover, we demonstrate that unit-level CWB is empirically linked to unit-level productivity (ρ = −.23), turnover (ρ = .22), customer satisfaction (ρ = −.26), and profit (ρ = −.31), which verifies the detrimental consequences of CWB at the strategic level. We conclude with a detailed discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this study as well as a clear plan for future research.",24,15,,"absenteeism/lateness, deviant/counterproductive behavior, strategic HRM, meta-analysis, research methods",,,Nichelle C.

"Volume 47, Issue 1","November 5, 2020",The Consequences of Participating in the Sharing Economy: A Transparency-Based Sharing Framework,"The sharing economy is estimated to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the global economy and is rapidly growing. However, trust-based commercial sharing—the participation in for-profit peer-to-peer sharing-economy activity—has negative as well as positive consequences for both the interacting parties and uninvolved third parties. To share responsibly, one needs to be aware of the various consequences of sharing. We provide a comprehensive, preregistered, systematic literature review of the consequences of trust-based commercial sharing, identifying 93 empirical papers spanning regions, sectors, and scientific disciplines. Via in-depth coding of the empirical work, we provide an authoritative overview of the economic, social, and psychological consequences of trust-based commercial sharing for involved parties, including service providers, users, and third parties. Based on the aggregate insights, we identify the common denominators for the positive and negative consequences. Whereas a well-functioning infrastructure of payment, insurance, and communication enables the positive consequences, ambiguity about rules, roles, and regulations causes non-negligible negative consequences. To overcome these negative consequences and promote more responsible forms of sharing, we propose the transparency-based sharing framework. Based on the framework, we outline an agenda for future research and discuss emerging managerial implications that arise when trying to increase transparency without jeopardizing the potential of trust-based commercial sharing.",48,40,,"on-demand economy, platform economy, gig economy, collaborative economy, trust",,,Nils C.

First, we review several key principles of the resource-based view (RBV) and show how they apply to community as a strategic resource, incorporating prior work that simultaneously addresses communities and RBV. Next, we juxtapose pairs of firms in the same industries, comparing those that have embraced this strategy with those that have not, demonstrating the superior sustainability of the firms that consider community as a strategic resource. Finally, we conclude with thoughts as to a future research agenda that allows for an expansion of the concept of resources to further the development of RBV, the firms that apply it, and the communities in which they are embedded. In doing so, we demonstrate how expanding RBV to incorporate the community as strategic resource contributes to managerial theory, research, and practice.",28,20,,"corporate social responsibility, resource-based view, sustainability",,,Cristina B.

"Volume 47, Issue 5","May 4, 2020",Team Decision Making: The Dynamic Effects of Team Decision Style Composition and Performance via Decision Strategy,"As teams continue to become more prevalent in modern-day organizations, researchers and organizations alike can benefit from a more nuanced understanding of teams’ decision-making process, which can ultimately impact organizational effectiveness. Although team processes are conceptualized as dynamic phenomena, they have largely been treated as static in research. In this study, we draw on the input-mediator-output-input and episodic team performance frameworks to advance a theoretical model of the dynamic, reciprocal effects of team rational decision strategy and team performance as well as the role of team composition of individual rational decision style. We sampled 320 participants in 85 teams competing in a 10-week business strategy simulation where teams made weekly strategic decisions that contributed to team performance. Teams composed of individuals with rational decision styles were more likely to adopt rational decision strategies, which led to better team performance. Additionally, results revealed a positive reciprocal effect between rational decision strategy and team performance such that teams with positive prior performance were more likely to engage in subsequent rational decision strategy. As hypothesized, team composition of members’ rational decision style was the primary determinant of team rational strategy during initial stages of team development, but the valence of outcome feedback (i.e., prior performance) took over as the stronger predictor of team rational strategy during later stages of team development. We contribute to the team and decision-making literatures by examining the dynamic process of team decision making and team performance.",18,15,,"team composition, team decision making, reciprocal relationships, rational strategy",,,X.

"Volume 47, Issue 8","July 16, 2020",Welcome Back? Job Performance and Turnover of Boomerang Employees Compared to Internal and External Hires,"“Boomerang” employees are workers who leave an organization and are later rehired by that same organization. Although many organizations rehire former employees, only a handful of studies have examined this phenomenon. The present study uses a large, longitudinal data set to examine the performance and turnover of boomerang employees rehired into management positions (n = 1,318). Further, we provide some of the first comparisons between boomerang employees and two traditional sources of employees: external hires (n = 20,850) and internal promotions (n = 8,546). Evaluations of job performance before and after being rehired revealed that boomerang managers’ performance tended to remain the same—rather than increase or decrease—after being rehired. Furthermore, boomerang managers performed similarly to internally and externally hired managers in the first year on the job, but both internal and external hires improved more than rehires over time. Internal and external hires were also less likely to turn over from the organization than rehires. Finally, supplemental analyses indicated that boomerang managers who turned over a second time tended to do so for reasons similar to their initial turnover reasons. The overall results call into question some of the assumed benefits of rehiring and suggest that organizations consider factors such as the reason for initial departure, the time horizon of performance, and the availability of other types of hires before considering boomerang employees.",10,7,,"staffing, boomerang employees, rehiring, internal labor markets, external hiring",,,John D.

"Volume 47, Issue 7","March 9, 2021",Using the Resource-Based View in Multinational Enterprise Research,"The resource-based view (RBV) has evolved into a preeminent theory of strategic management. It is widely used by international business (IB) scholars since there is considerable synergy in core research questions pursued by IB and strategy researchers. However, in research on multinational enterprise (MNE) behavior, the use of RBV remains limited relative to other influential perspectives, such as the eclectic paradigm, the Uppsala model, and institutional theory. This is not surprising since the RBV was developed to explain performance differentials between country-centric firms with dominant product businesses rather than large MNEs with an expansive product-geographic scope. We describe how these limitations arise from the wider range of outcomes and explanatory variables, multiple levels of analysis, and the spatial, economic, and institutional barriers that are relevant to MNEs. We discuss the application of RBV to MNE research by the first author and other IB scholars. We then provide directions on how future research could use RBV more fruitfully to examine MNE performance and sources of competitive advantage in several areas. These include diversified corporations, subsidiary agglomeration, emerging market MNE internationalization, subsidiary autonomy, international joint ventures and alliances, and corporate social responsibility. Drawing upon teaching case examples from the first author’s work, we also point to the effectiveness of RBV in teaching with business cases, given its focus on firm performance (strategy).",18,14,,"resource-based view, multinational enterprises, strategy, international business, limitations, future research, teaching cases",,,Paul W.

We also quantitatively examine the conceptualizations of recovery as activities, experiences, or states in terms of both their intercorrelations and differing effects with demands, resources, well-being, and performance. Results of meta-analyses using a total of 198 empirical samples indicated general support for the hypothesized positive relationships between employee recovery and resources, well-being, and performance as well as a negative relationship with demands. However, the size and consistency of observed effects differed markedly based on the conceptualization utilized. Additionally, various conceptualizations of recovery were shown to be only modestly related, while recovery experiences and the state of being recovered were shown to have substantial temporal consistency. Implications of these findings for scholars studying recovery and practitioners are discussed.",97,80,,"stress, meta-analysis, well-being, occupational health and safety",,,Laurens Bujold Steed,Miami University,,,Brian W.

"Volume 47, Issue 6","November 27, 2020",Platform Competition: A Systematic and Interdisciplinary Review of the Literature,"Over the past three decades, platform competition—the competition between firms that facilitate transactions and govern interactions between two or more distinct user groups who are connected via an indirect network—has attracted significant interest from the fields of management and organizations, information systems, economics, and marketing. Despite common interests in research questions, methodologies, and empirical contexts by scholars from across these fields, the literature has developed mostly in isolated fashion. This article offers a systematic and interdisciplinary review of the literature on platform competition by analyzing a sample of 333 articles published between 1985 and 2019. The review contributes by (a) documenting how the literature on platform competition has evolved; (b) outlining four themes of shared scholarly interest, including how network effects generate “winner-takes-all” dynamics that influence strategies, such as pricing and quality; how network externalities and platform strategy interact with corporate-level decisions, such as vertical integration or diversification into complementary goods; how heterogeneity in the platform and its users influences platform dynamics; and how the platform “hub” orchestrates value creation and capture in the overall ecosystem; and (c) highlighting several areas for future research. The review aims to facilitate a broader understanding of the platform competition research that helps to advance our knowledge of how platforms compete to create and capture value.",125,88,,"platform, ecosystem, complementor, two-sided market, competition",,,Joost Rietveld,University College London,,,Melissa A.

We integrate resource-based theories with research on interruptions to position organizational expectations for e-mail monitoring (OEEM) during nonwork time as a psychological stressor that elicits anxiety due to employee attention allocation conflict. E-mail–triggered anxiety, in turn, negatively affects the health and relationship quality of employees and their significant others. We conducted three studies to test our propositions. Using the experience sampling method with 108 working U.S. adults, Study 1 established within-employee effects of OEEM on anxiety, employee health, and relationship conflict. Study 2 used a sample of 138 dyads of full-time employees and their significant others to replicate detrimental health and relationship effects of OEEM through anxiety. It also showed crossover effects of OEEM on partner health and relationship satisfaction. Finally, Study 3 employed a two-wave data collection method with an online sample of 162 U.S. working adults to provide additional support for the OEEM construct as a distinct and reliable job stressor and replicated findings from Studies 1 and 2. Taken together, our research extends the literature on work-related electronic communication at the interface of work and nonwork boundaries, deepening our understanding of the impact of OEEM on employees and their families’ health and well-being.",31,26,,"electronic communication, job demands-resources model, interruptions, anxiety, health, crossover effects",,,William J.

Particularly in low uncertainty markets, executives have the foresight and time to build strategically valuable resources in current markets and leverage them into related markets. RBV is also relevant for understanding strategies for market entry, extending the value of technology resources, and broadening the locus of resources within ecosystems. Conversely, in high uncertainty markets like nascent or disrupted ones, RBV seems less germane. Resources may not yet exist or their value (and rarity) may be indeterminate (or changing). Here, we contribute the Strategy Creation (SC) view—joining strategizing by doing, thinking, and shaping. It offers a strategic logic that fits highly uncertain markets. Finally, we contribute the insight that RBV and SC are complements under moderate uncertainty, such as growth markets and technology transitions.

We investigate whether (in)congruence in terms of immigration background between employees and customers is linked to customer complaints. Controlling for service quality, we find that both congruence scenarios (both or neither migrants) are associated with fewer complaints, the latter suggesting that migrants identify with each other despite national and cultural differences. Results from the two incongruence scenarios show increased complaints. In Study 1, we find that units that receive more complaints experience higher rates of voluntary employee withdrawal behaviors (short-term absenteeism and voluntary turnover), highlighting how unfair customer complaints can hurt organizations twice, by increasing the risk of loss in both customers and employees.

Taking such a dynamic perspective on leader behaviors, we examined daily servant leadership behavior and its downstream effects on the leaders themselves from a within-person self-regulation perspective. Results from two experience sampling studies consistently revealed that engaging in daily servant leadership behavior can come at a cost for the leaders. Specifically, for leaders who are low in perspective taking, engaging in servant leadership behavior was associated with increases in same-day depletion and next-day withdrawal from their leadership role (i.e., greater laissez-faire behavior). However, for leaders who frequently exercise perspective taking, engaging in daily servant leadership behavior was instead associated with decreases in depletion and subsequent laissez-faire behavior, suggesting that servant leadership behaviors are replenishing for these individuals. Experience in perspective taking is therefore a key individual difference that determines whether enacting servant leadership behavior is beneficial or detrimental for leaders.

"Volume 47, Issue 7","April 15, 2021",Resources for What? Understanding Performance in the Resource-Based View and Strategic Human Capital Resource Literatures,"Barney’s presentation of the resource-based view (RBV) profoundly shaped the trajectory of management scholarship. This article considers the RBV’s impact specifically on the field of strategic human capital resources. Although Barney is still highly relevant, I suggest that research has not sufficiently appreciated the role that individual and collective performance behavior and outcomes play in linking human capital resources to competitive advantage. An alternative, what might be called RBV2.0, posits that research needs to recognize that human capital resources are distinct from performance behavior and outcomes. Such an observation raises the question, “Resources for what?” Answering this question leads to several important insights. First, a given type of human capital resource is only important to the extent it is related to performance behavior and outcomes that contribute to competitive advantage. Second, performance behavior is largely strategy-specific and thus firm-specific. Third, firm specificity is not a characteristic of human capital resources but rather a function of the proximity of the resource to firm-specific performance behavior and outcomes. Consequently, “Performance” is the answer to the question, “Resources for what?” This emphasis on understanding human capital resource-performance relationships adds considerable precision into the RBV, helps resolve puzzles in the strategic human capital literature relating to firm specificity and performance mobility, and promotes a deeper understanding hiding latent within Barney’s original view.",33,23,,"strategic human capital resources, resource-based view, performance, resources",,,Robert E.

In an effort to rectify this problem we (a) explain the differences between implicit and explicit individual differences, (b) introduce the key psychological mechanism associated with these implicit individual differences as conceptualized through CR (JMs), (c) describe how researchers can identify JMs, and (d) discuss how JMs may be measured with CR items.

Yet fundamental questions remain regarding which aspects of men’s and women’s networks differ and how differences impact their careers. To spur future research to address these questions, we present an integrative framework to clarify how and why gender and networks—in concert—may explain career inequality. We delineate two distinct, complementary explanations: (1) unequal network characteristics (UNC) asserts that men and women have different network characteristics, which account for differences in career success; (2) unequal network returns (UNR) asserts that even when men and women have the same network characteristics, they yield different degrees of career success. Further, we explain why UNC and UNR emerge by identifying mechanisms related to professional contexts, actors, and contacts. Using this framework, we review evidence of UNC and UNR for specific network characteristics. We found that men’s and women’s networks are similar in structure (i.e., size, openness, closeness, contacts’ average and structural status) but differ in composition (i.e., proportion of men, same-gender, and kin contacts). Many differences mattered for career success. We identified evidence of UNC only (same-gender contacts), UNR only (actors’ and contacts’ network openness, contacts’ relative status), neither UNC nor UNR (size), and both UNC and UNR (proportion of men contacts). Based on these initial findings, we offer guidance to organizations aiming to address inequality resulting from gender differences in network creation and utilization, and we present a research agenda for scholars to advance these efforts.",30,26,,"gender, networks, career success, career inequality",,,Meredith L.

The latter then again positively predicts team unit stress (i.e., the supervisors’ group of followers) and, eventually, results in decreased team helping behavior of supervisors’ followers. We tested this model using data from a large, multisource field study. The results provide support for our trickle-down model in that department managers’ differentiated transformational leadership decreased team helping behavior two hierarchical levels below the manager via increasing department unit stress (Stage 1 mediator), supervisor differentiated transformational leadership (Stage 2 mediator), and team unit stress (Stage 3 mediator).",8,7,,"differentiated leadership, transformational leadership, trickle-down, helping behavior, stress, conservation of resources",,,Kai C.

We argue that a downside of this process is that newcomers’ social integration and acculturation may be weakened. This suggests declining levels of FSB may result in decreased organizational commitment across time and ultimately greater turnover likelihood. These predictions were examined in two longitudinal studies (Study 1, N = 158; Study 2, N = 170) among newcomers. In both studies, FSB by supervisor inquiry was found to decline across time, and the decrease in FSB preceded a steeper decline in affective organizational commitment. In Study 1, the decline of commitment also resulted in a steeper decrease in FSB. Study 2 further found the decline in commitment to mediate the relationship between the decrease in FSB and increased turnover intention. Finally, increased turnover intention mediated the relationship between the decline in commitment and increased turnover the following year. Bridging research on FSB and organizational commitment, these findings shed new light on the influence of the dynamics of FSB on newcomer turnover.",30,26,,"feedback-seeking behavior, organizational commitment, turnover, growth/longitudinal modeling",,,Christian Vandenberghe,HEC Montréal,,,Guylaine Landry,,,,Kathleen Bentein,Université du Québec à Montréal,,,Frederik Anseel,Ghent University,,,Karim Mignonac,,,,Patrice Roussel,University of Toulouse 1 Capitole,,

Yet, the field is limited in understanding why such a leadership approach affects employees’ positive and negative contributions in the workplace. Drawing on social exchange theory, we theorize that supervisors high in BLM can influence employees’ felt obligation toward the bottom line, which in turn can influence employees’ task performance and unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB). We also examine employee ambition as a moderator of this process. Using three-wave, multisource data collected from the financial services industry, our results revealed that high-BLM supervisors elevate employee task performance as well as UPB by motivating employees’ felt obligation toward the bottom line. Furthermore, we found that employee ambition served as a first-stage moderator, such that the mediated relationships were stronger when employee ambition was high as opposed to low.

Thus, strategic management scholars and organization theorists are like howler monkeys and spider monkeys, coexisting peacefully in the same ecosystem by dining on different dependent variables.

Yet, these two lines of investigation are largely unintegrated. Drawing on a social control perspective, we integrate these two forms of controlling behaviors into one coherent model and link them to employee proactive behaviors. We propose that authoritarian leadership and abusive supervision substitute effects from each other in thwarting followers’ proactivity by increasing their perceived powerlessness. We then test our hypotheses with three field samples of Chinese supervisor-subordinate dyads, using different exemplary behaviors to operationalize proactivity (i.e., taking charge, personal initiative, and proactive performance). The findings across the three studies show that authoritarian leadership and abusive supervision weaken each other’s effects in terms of inhibiting subordinate proactive behaviors. Moreover, in our third study, perceived powerlessness mediates this interaction effect. These results, however, do not generalize to employee affiliative behaviors, operationalized as altruism, cooperation, and conscientious behaviors.

"Volume 47, Issue 6","May 4, 2020",Incorporating Job Demand Variability Into Job Demands Theory: A Meta-Analysis,"A rich history of research on job demands suggests that employees’ demands at work are related to their strain and engagement. This research often considers job demands to be fixed and stable over the course of workers’ experiences, despite the existing research showing that some employees experience high levels of job demands one day and low levels the next. We seek to extend research on job demands by introducing the idea that different employees experience different levels of job demand variability (i.e., variability in job demands over workers’ daily experiences). Relying on arousal theory, we posit that job demand variability moderates the between-person effects of overall job demand levels on employee strain and engagement. To test our theory, we conduct a meta-analytic path analysis of the existing experience sampling methodology research on challenge and hindrance job demands. Results show that the between-person effects of challenge (on strain and engagement) and hindrance demands (on engagement only) are stronger in studies where those demands have higher levels of daily within-person variability. Unexpectedly, the relationship between hindrance demands and strain was similarly strong across lower and higher degrees of variability. Our study suggests a need for more nuanced theory that explains how job demand variability plays a role in employee outcomes. Further, we conducted a simulation study to validate our methodology, offering utility to the broader management literature applying meta-analysis to study within-person variability.

Next, we briefly address the key roles of microfoundations and complementarity in helping understand the potential for value creation and value capture through the use of best practices. We then ask whether the use of best practices in the pursuit of competitive parity might warrant greater attention as this may be where the largest potential gains can be made. Finally, we consider a number of developments in the strategic HC literature, especially those related to firm-specific human capital (FSHC). We raise questions with views on issues such as the consequences of FSHC for workers; the definition and measurement of FSHC; whether worker immobility, a key to value capture, is good from a social return (or even a firm) return perspective; and the relative emphasis on value capture and value creation.",38,30,,"the resource-based view of the firm, human resources, human capital, a conceptual review",,,Barry Gerhart,University of Wisconsin-Madison,,,Jie Feng,Rutgers University,,

We do so by drawing on another highly visible group dispersion literature in the management domain, group diversity, based on the recognition that LMX quality is a characteristic on which group members vary. Utilizing insights from Harrison and Klein’s typology of group diversity constructs, we introduce a framework that specifies the meaning and shape of three variations of differentiated leader-member relationships in groups and connects each construct with implications in terms of theorizing and measurement. Specifically, our framework conceptualizes LMX differentiation as LMX separation (dispersion in LMX relationships as disagreement or opposition regarding an opinion, perception, or position), LMX variety (dispersion in LMX relationships as distinctiveness in kind, source, or category), and LMX disparity (dispersion in LMX relationships as inequality in concentration of valued social assets or resources). We then apply this framework to conduct a systematic review of the LMX differentiation literature with particular attention to alignment among a study’s descriptions of the construct, application of theory, expected group outcomes, and construct measurement. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research and for applying our framework to enhance reliability, validity, and generalizability in studies of LMX differentiation and group outcomes.",31,30,,"leadership, groups/group processes/dynamics, leader-member exchange, teams",,,Claudia Buengeler,Kiel University and University of Amsterdam,,,Ronald F.

Examining investor valuations of 1,676 initial public offerings (IPOs) in the United States from 1990 to 2011, we find that reputation transfer through an association of an IPO firm with a venture capital (VC) firm represents a resource whose value can increase/decrease over time depending on investors’ valuations of prior IPOs funded by a VC firm. We conclude that the impact of reputation transfer through association is not unidirectional but, instead, is to be viewed in the context of prior reputational development of organizations the focal firm is associated with. Furthermore, we find that three “transfer enhancers” can improve the impact of VC firm reputation transfer on IPO valuations, including the VC firm’s past experience intensity, the diversity of IPO experiences, and the number of prior syndicated IPOs involving the VC firm as a lead investor.",17,16,,"initial public offerings, venture capital, reputation transfer",,,Salim Chahine,American University of Beirut,,,Igor Filatotchev,King’s College London,,,Garry D.

As a result, it has been widely used to explain entrepreneurial firms’ strategic choices that generate such an advantage. While researchers have established the usefulness of the RBV, they have overlooked the fundamental question of how entrepreneurial firms manage their resources to gain competitive advantage. This paper examines this issue in the context of independently owned startups, which typically lack resources, are constrained in their access to key resource providers, and have limited experience in assembling and managing resources. Adopting a broader conceptualization of startups’ resource management process, the paper identifies several questionable assumptions in related RBV-based research. Further, recognizing the limits of RBV to determine ex ante the nature and magnitude of entrepreneurs’ resourcefulness when managing their resources, the paper suggests linkages between the RBV and several entrepreneurship frameworks and outlines promising research questions.",60,48,,"resource-based view, RBV, startups, resource management processes, VRIO, resourcefulness",,,Shaker A.

While prior research has supported the beneficial effects of prodiversity climates (i.e., work environments that employees view as fair and socially integrative of all personnel) on worker attitudes and behaviors, less is known about the potential boundary conditions of diversity climate-outcome relationships. To address this concern, we conducted a meta-analysis of diversity climate using 109 independent samples from 94 studies. Meta-analytic results indicate that diversity climate–outcome relationships are moderated by climate measure type, outcome type, demographic diversity, climate strength, and measurement source. These findings show that diversity climate is more strongly related to outcomes when measured as inclusion climate (vs. diversity climate), for attitudinal outcomes compared to performance and withdrawal criteria, when work contexts are more racially and ethnically diverse, when personnel exhibit stronger versus weaker agreement in their diversity climate perceptions, and when diversity climate and outcome data are collected from the same source versus different sources.

As a result, we know little about this critical property of team trust, its determinants, and independent impact on team outcomes. We address this limitation by examining “team trust consensus”—a configural group construct capturing the extent to which team members share their levels of trust in the team—as a variable of theoretical and empirical interest in its own right. Cross-sectional data from a work team sample (Study 1, N = 120) provide initial support for our propositions that national culture diversity negatively affects trust consensus and that trust consensus positively affects team performance. Expanding on these findings, we propose a contingency model in which the negative impact of national culture diversity is mitigated by team virtuality and collective leadership. Multiwave data from an MBA team sample (Study 2, N = 95) offer support for these propositions and replicate the positive direct effect of trust consensus on team performance. Our findings indicate trust consensus is an important predictor of team performance and provide unique insight into the factors that jointly influence trust consensus within teams.",20,12,,"trust, teams, cultural diversity, virtuality, collective leadership, performance",,,Bart de Jong,Australian Catholic University,,,Nicole Gillespie,University of Queensland,,,Ian Williamson,Victoria University of Wellington,,,Carol Gill,University of Melbourne,,

Despite the generation of a considerable amount of knowledge, which is clearly relevant to practice, the science–practice gap continues to persist. We challenge past notions that areas of management have not sufficiently developed to be prescriptive. The Editorial leadership of the Journal of Management commissioned our team to change the conversation on the science–practice gap by changing the question to one which focuses on adherence. We introduce an adherence-based framework from the medical literature to advance the conversation on the science–practice gap in management. This includes a rubric that identifies five criteria to evaluate the prescriptive readiness of research (theoretical grounding, rigor, relevance, practical recommendations, and communication) that produce five levels of research advancement (exploratory, preliminary, option, guidelines, and standards). We identify how scholars and practitioners can overcome structural, social, and psychological barriers to adherence (make recommendations possible, easy, normative, rewarding, and sometimes required).

"Volume 47, Issue 4","October 22, 2019",The Role of Firm Size and Knowledge Intensity in the Performance Effects of Collective Turnover,"As employees are among firms’ most important resources and labor markets are facing serious labor shortages, firm-level collective turnover is one of the most important challenges facing organizations. Context-emergent turnover theory provides a theoretical framework for the performance implications of collective turnover and argues that context, and in particular, firm size, plays a crucial role in the collective turnover–performance relationship. Yet, the moderating role of firm size remains undertheorized, empirically understudied, and thus, unclear. Based on the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a theoretical framework for two competing perspectives (a negative and a positive one) on the role of firm size and put forward the firm’s knowledge intensity as a crucial additional moderator. The main premise is that whereas firm size determines what resources firms have to successfully cope with turnover, knowledge intensity determines the resources firms need to do so. We propose a three-way interaction, suggesting that firm size reinforces the harmful effect of turnover in highly knowledge-intensive firms and buffers it in firms with low levels of knowledge intensity. Using a unique multi-industry and longitudinal administrative data set of 6,913 Belgian firms (2012–2016), we find support for these assumptions. This study highlights the importance of the context in which firms have to deal with turnover, and it spurs researchers to go beyond studying turnover in narrow study contexts, to take into account the interplay among different but intertwined organizational contingencies, and to acknowledge both the quantitative (how many employees leave) and qualitative components (who leaves) of turnover.",20,14,,"collective turnover, context-emergent turnover theory, firm size, knowledge intensity, firm performance",,,Kim De Meulenaere,,,,Sophie De Winne,KU Leuven,,,Elise Marescaux,IESEG School of Management,,,Stijn Vanormelingen,KU Leuven,,

In this article, we employ a stakeholder bargaining power perspective to argue that this effect is most pronounced when the firm’s bonds are concentrated in the hands of bond blockholders. Furthermore, we contend that the temporal orientation of bondholders influences this relationship. Specifically, while it is commonly assumed that bondholders have a limited temporal orientation that induces them to focus on short-term value appropriation, we argue that some bond blockholders adopt a long-term temporal orientation. This orientation, in turn, makes them more inclined to support long-term value creation for the firm in the form of enhanced investments in R&D. Moreover, while agency theory suggests that there is an inherent conflict of interest between shareholders and bondholders, our results suggest that the temporal orientation of investors (i.e., both shareholders and bondholders) matters much more than whether they invested in the firm’s equity or its debt.",5,5,,"innovation, bargaining power, bondholders, investor time horizon, value creation and appropriation",,,Pengfei Ye,Virginia Tech,,,Jonathan O’Brien,University of Nebraska,,,Christina Matz Carnes,Indiana University,,,Iftekhar Hasan,Fordham University,,

Integrating insights from the literature on profit persistence with the behavioral theory of the firm, we propose a persistence-based framework of organizational innovative search that connects the persistence characteristics of feedback from peer and historical referents with innovative search. We first predict that feedback from peer referents is more persistent than feedback from historical referents. Further, we theorize that peer performance feedback produces more pronounced effects: Performance above (below) peer aspiration leads to less (more) innovative search compared with performance above (below) the historical aspiration level. In addition, because industries impose heterogeneous levels of profit persistence, the differential effect between peer and historical performance feedback on innovative search is likely to be more evident in highly persistent industries. Examining the research-and-development intensity of a comprehensive panel of Compustat manufacturing firms over the past 45 years, our results from quasi–maximum likelihood analysis and fixed-effect panel regression largely support our theoretical development.

Moral identity strengthened the relationship between witnessed incivility and moral outrage, while rule-based moral thinking orientation weakened the relationship between moral outrage and destructive punitive reaction. Moral identity strengthened the relationship between moral outrage and constructive punitive reaction.

While central to the political view of the firm, the research on organizational coalitions has evoked diverse characterizations of its members, their relationship with the rest of the organization, and how coalitions balance conflicts and compromise. The result is a fragmented literature that has limited the theoretical clarity necessary to appreciate one of the most important forms of collective political influence in organizations. Drawing on six decades of research, we offer a systematic review of organizational coalitions. We anchor our review on the actors who are party to a coalition, the structures that characterize the boundaries of a coalition, and the processes that lead to a coalition’s influence. This synthesis reveals significant overlaps with regard to the definition of actors, their structural positions, and the perpetual nature of conflict and negotiations. Yet we also note significant divergence in the interactions between actors, how the structure of a coalition maps onto that of an organization, and the processes that affect a coalition’s bargaining position and outcomes. These divergences reveal six distinct streams of research. Using our actor-structure-process model, we organize these research streams into a framework that identifies the diverse conceptualizations as contextual and reconcilable manifestations of a common underlying construct, thus yielding a dynamic model of organizational coalitions. Building on this framework, we propose an agenda for future research.",11,12,,"coalition, conflict, negotiation, behavioral theory of the firm",,,Murad A. Mithani,Rutgers University,,,Jonathan P.

Drawing on the director role literature, we argue that politician-directors are likely to serve as valuable resource providers but are less likely to serve as guardians of shareholder interests. In light of this trade-off, investors will infer the expected value of politician appointments on the basis of the director role that they perceive as most needed by a particular firm within the specific institutional context in which it is embedded. We test our predictions using an extensive data set of 345 separate appointment events across 14 countries over a period of 10 years. Our findings show that politician appointments are associated with both resource-provisionary benefits and governance-based costs but that the perceived level of corruption in a country critically conditions both. Specifically, perceived corruption can be seen to function as a double-edged sword that increases both the expected benefits and the expected costs of politician appointments.",18,15,,"board of directors, corporate political activity, corruption, event study, politician appointments",,,Omar El Nayal,Universidade Católica Portuguesa,,,J.

We conduct a set of studies that uses multisource data, data across time, and data from three countries. Our results reveal that linguistic ostracism was associated with the enactment of lower interpersonal citizenship behaviors and higher interpersonal deviance behaviors. We find that disidentification served as a mechanism to explain why linguistic ostracism resulted in interpersonal citizenship behaviors and interpersonal deviance behaviors. Furthermore, linguistically ostracized employees with low (vs. high) social self-efficacy engage in fewer interpersonal citizenship behaviors and greater interpersonal deviance behaviors.

The average of every adjustment variable was higher at the latest data collection point, indicating that time was on newcomers’ side and was related, overall, to higher adjustment levels. Finally, we explored which resources related to the three newcomer adjustment indicators and the shapes adjustment trajectories took depending on resources at organizational entry. Results indicated that personal resources (proactive personality, optimism, and organizational knowledge) were related to early adjustment. Regarding material resources, having a work station ready the first day on the job was related to adjustment. For social resources, meeting one’s manager the first day on the job was related to early social acceptance.

This study investigates the role of short sellers in shaping managerial acquisitiveness and M&A decision quality. Short sellers impose a downward pressure on stock prices by disseminating negative information to the market. Given that managerial wealth and job security hinge on stock prices, top managers respond to increased short selling by refraining from excessive M&A activities because M&As could provide opportunities for short sellers to spread negative information and dampen stock prices. Furthermore, the negative influence of short sellers on managerial acquisitiveness is enhanced by the market for corporate control as an external governance mechanism and by CEO equity ownership as an internal governance mechanism. When firms with increasing short selling do engage in M&As, they gain higher M&A announcement returns and operating performance.

"Volume 47, Issue 4","ary 27, 2020",Knowledge Recombination and Inventor Networks: The Asymmetric Effects of Embeddedness on Knowledge Reuse and Impact,"Inventors are triply embedded. They are embedded in a network of knowledge components that they can reuse in future inventions. They are embedded in an inventor network, where internal embeddedness (the strength of relationships between focal inventors and their colleagues upon whose knowledge the team builds) and network centrality influence access to information. Finally, they are embedded in the firm, with its specific routines that favor external or internal knowledge search, what we call search orientation. Using a sample of 39,785 semiconductor patents, we study the pattern of knowledge reuse, or the recombination of technologically similar components, on invention impact. We propose that reuse of internal knowledge affects invention impact in a concave manner and posit that internal embeddedness steepens this relationship while network centrality leads to an inflection point shift. We examine whether these effects differ for subsamples of firms with inward- or outward-looking search orientation. We find that inward-looking firms’ optimal pattern of internal knowledge reuse does not differ markedly from that of outward-looking firms. We find that inward-looking firms are more susceptible to internal embeddedness and that centrality in the collaborative network flattens rather than shifts the relationship between reuse and impact. These findings elevate the theoretical discourse of embeddedness from the effects of network positions on innovation outcomes to similar network positions having asymmetric effects that vary with the firm’s search orientation.

In the context of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), we examine how CEO greed impacts firms’ stance toward corporate social responsibility (CSR) prior to the onset of the GFC and how this, in turn, shapes firms’ fate during and after the GFC. We argue that CEO greed will be negatively associated with CSR, because in their unbridled pursuit of personal wealth, greedy CEOs are more likely to exhibit myopic behaviors and neglect investment in CSR. We also adopt a person-pay interactionist logic to theorize that the willingness of greedy executives to invest in CSR will be especially sensitive to different types of pay instruments. Next, we build on recent findings from research on CSR that suggest that stakeholder engagement is a defining feature of resilient organizations. We expect that, due to low CSR investment, firms led by greedy CEOs will experience greater losses in the short run and will take longer time to recover from the 2008 GFC.

Integrating the generalism and specialization views of human capital, we postulate that at an initial level, the acquisition of experience breadth from different firms and industries enables CEOs to broaden their knowledge base, obtain a variety of skills, and thus increase their labor market value and initial compensation. After a threshold, however, the accumulation of extensive levels of career generalism through frequent job hopping across firm and industry contexts gradually causes a lack of experience depth and insufficient career specialization, thereby triggering lower CEO market value and initial pay. Data from 197 CEO appointments in large, publicly traded firms support our predictions.

An Analysis of Constructive Replication in the Organizational Sciences","Replication is an essential part of any science, confirming or adjusting our understanding of the world through repeated exploration of a phenomenon of interest. While there has been an increased interest in the role of replication studies, there also exists skepticism regarding the need for more replication. Our empirical analysis of 406 recent studies that use the term “replication” suggests that this criticism stems from a lack of appreciation of the different forms that replication can take, the prevalence (or lack thereof) of many of these forms, and the objectives that are met by one of the least common forms, constructive replication. As such, the purposes of our paper are (1) to explore the different forms that constructive replication can take and the objectives at which each can be directed, (2) to distinguish these forms from other forms of replication with which they are often confused, (3) to determine how common each form of replication is in our field, and (4) to provide concrete examples of different forms of constructiveness from published studies in order to pave the way towards more (and more useful) replications in the future.",85,85,,"replication, constructive replication, research design, empirical contribution",,,Tine Köhler,The University of Melbourne,,,Jose M.
